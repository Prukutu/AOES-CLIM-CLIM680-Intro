<!-- ### How will this class work in Zoom?

* Registered students will receive a recurring Zoom invitation for this class that will contain the link.
* If your bandwidth allows and you are comfortable doing so, please leave your camera on. I will aim to do the same.
* Please mute if you are not speaking. I will mute you if there is significant background noise.
* I highly encourage interactions, questions, discussion, etc. It can be difficult in an online environment to make sure everyone gets the opportunity to speak.  To encourage interactions and make it easy for everyone to interact, if you wish to speak, please use one of the following methods:
   * raise your hand using the Zoom hand raise feature,
   * type in the shared document,
   * type in the Zoom chat window
* I will attempt to monitor each of these and acknowledge people in the order in which they requested to speak.
* This class will be recorded in Zoom. Videos will be posted on the course Blackboard site.  Videos may also be used in other GMU courses or video snippets that do not identify students may be used in public forum (e.g. website, twitter, etc.) as an example or advertisement of online course instruction. If you have privacy concerns, please speak to me ASAP.
* Please be patient with technical issues as we all learn how best to do online learning via Zoom and do the best we can with our personal home internet.  Your feedback however is also welcome and encouraged.  See Feedback section below.

### Best ways to contact us

1. _Email_: We will respond to emails within 24hrs during the work week and on Mon morning for emails that arrive over the weekend.  If you have not heard a response by this time, then we may not have received your email, so please re-send.
3. _Office Hours_: Please email us both if you wish to meet outside of class and we will schedule a time to meet in person or via Blackboard Collaborate Ultra.

### Class Attendance

This is a face-to-face course. It is in your best interest to attend class during the scheduled class time - please don't be late.

_Live Coding_: One of the reasons you should attend class in person is that this class will utilize a methodology called “Live Coding”.  This means you will follow along with the Instructor(s) while we share and write code on the screen and explain the code as we go.  There will be no PowerPoint presentations. This method is shown to be effective because it slows down the pace so everyone can keep up, allows us to take the time to explain what we are doing, helps you get accustomed to running codes yourself on your computer setup, and lets us see you make mistakes and how to correct them.

#### _If you miss class_

We understand, however that there can be various reasons for missing class and that connectivity issues do occur.  If you miss class for whatever reason, all the lesson material will be available online.

### Continuity Plans

Given the current times, there are constant changes and new University guidance regarding University operations.  There is also the possibility that a student, instructor, or family member that they care for may become ill and alternate arragements will need to be made.

We will follow all University guidance.  Typically we learn official University guidance at the same time as you.  We will promptly follow up with you about how the latest guidance impacts this class.

In the event that you as a student are unable to continue with the course, please notify us immediately so that we can discuss your options.  With two Instructors, hopefully there will be no disruptions, but we will continue as planned at the same day/time with a backup instructor if necessary.

### How will you be graded?

This course requires students to apply the analysis techniques learned in class on sample datasets to a dataset used in their own research. Your grade will consiste of 50% _homework assignments_ and 50% your _final project_ and calculated as follows:

* Homework Assignments: 50%
* Final Project: 50% (25% Github repository and website; 25% presentation)

#### _Assignments_
Assignments are given most weeks and require you to add something to the previous week’s analysis of your dataset.  It is in your best interest to complete these assignments on time in order to keep up with the class.  Assignments will be given in class. Several of the assignments will be formally graded. You will provide a Github link to turn in your assignment. Instructions will be provided in class.

Assignments will be graded as satisfactory (A), not satisfactory (C), or not/minimally attempted (F) promptly after the due date. Feedback will be provided via Blackboard or Github Issues.

If the assignment is graded not satisfactory or not attempted, you may redo the assignment until it is satisfactory until the last day of class (Dec 3). You must notify us if/when you wish to us to re-grade a re-submitted assignment.

#### _Final Project_
In addition to the four graded assignments, You are also expected to complete a project with a website in Github and give a presentation in class of your project. Project details will be provided in class and posted on Blackboard.

#### _Exams_
This class has no exams.

### University Policies

#### _Evolving COVID Situation_ 

All students are required to follow the university’s public health and safety precautions and procedures outlined on the university Safe Return to Campus webpage (https://www2.gmu.edu/safe-return-campus). All students in this course must also complete the Mason COVID Health Check daily. Only students who receive a green notification are permitted to attend courses in class. Faculty are allowed to ask you to show them your green notification. If you suspect that you are sick or have been directed to self-isolate, please quarantine and get testing.

GMU requires vaccinations for all students who work, study, or live on campus. This includes those who attend classes. There is nothing better than the in-person learning experience, but if you have a medical or religious exemption, we will set up an online live stream of the lectures via Blackboard. We will also set up the streaming option on Blackboard in the case of excused absence options for students receiving vaccination, with side effects after vaccination, or receiving positive test results or diagnosis requiring quarantine. __Let us know in advance of class if you need the streaming option.__ If you are healthy – please be in class!  

If the campus closes, or if a class meeting needs to be canceled or adjusted due to weather or other reasons, notices will be posted to Blackboard and emailed to all registered students. 

#### _Academic integrity_

It is expected that students adhere to the George Mason University Honor Code as it relates to integrity regarding coursework and grades.  The Honor Code reads as follows: To promote a stronger sense of mutual responsibility, respect, trust, and fairness among all members of the George Mason University community and with the desire for greater academic and personal achievement, we, the student members of the University Community have set forth this: Student members of the George Mason University community pledge __not__ to cheat, plagiarize, steal and/or lie in matters related to academic work. More information about the Honor Code, including definitions of cheating, lying, and plagiarism, can be found at the Office of Academic Integrity website at (http://oai.gmu.edu).  __In this class, working together is strongly encouraged and doing so is not a violation of the Honor Code.  Each student must complete their own model runs, their own analysis codes and figures, and their own writeup of the assignment.__

#### _Diversity and Inclusion_

This class aims to be an intentionally inclusive community that promotes and maintains an equitable and just work and learning environment. We welcome and value individuals and their differences including race, economic status, gender expression and identity, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, national origin, first language, religion, age, and disability.
