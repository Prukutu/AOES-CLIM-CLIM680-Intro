<!-- ### How will this class work in Zoom?

* Registered students will receive a recurring Zoom invitation for this class that will contain the link.
* If your bandwidth allows and you are comfortable doing so, please leave your camera on. I will aim to do the same.
* Please mute if you are not speaking. I will mute you if there is significant background noise.
* I highly encourage interactions, questions, discussion, etc. It can be difficult in an online environment to make sure everyone gets the opportunity to speak.  To encourage interactions and make it easy for everyone to interact, if you wish to speak, please use one of the following methods:
   * raise your hand using the Zoom hand raise feature,
   * type in the shared document,
   * type in the Zoom chat window
* I will attempt to monitor each of these and acknowledge people in the order in which they requested to speak.
* This class will be recorded in Zoom. Videos will be posted on the course Blackboard site.  Videos may also be used in other GMU courses or video snippets that do not identify students may be used in public forum (e.g. website, twitter, etc.) as an example or advertisement of online course instruction. If you have privacy concerns, please speak to me ASAP.
* Please be patient with technical issues as we all learn how best to do online learning via Zoom and do the best we can with our personal home internet.  Your feedback however is also welcome and encouraged.  See Feedback section below.

### Best ways to contact us

1. _Blackboard Discussion Board_: For general questions, problems, etc. addressed to the other students as well as instructors.  We realize there is a wide range of expertise among the students and instructors - we can all help each other solve problems and learn via this open forum.
2. _Email_: For questions directed only to the instructors. We will respond to emails within 24hrs during the work week and on Mon morning for emails that arrive over the weekend.  If you have not heard a response by this time, then we may not have received your email, so please re-send.
4. _Office Hours_: Please email us both if you wish to meet outside of class and we will schedule a time to meet in person or via Blackboard Collaborate Ultra.

### Class Attendance

This is a face-to-face course. It is in your best interest to attend class during the scheduled class time - please don't be late.

_Live Coding_: One of the reasons you should attend class in person is that this class will utilize a methodology called “Live Coding”.  This means you will follow along with the Instructor(s) while we share and write code on the screen and explain the code as we go. There will be no PowerPoint presentations. This method is shown to be effective because it slows down the pace so everyone can keep up, allows us to take the time to explain what we are doing, helps you get accustomed to running codes yourself on your computer setup, and lets us see you make mistakes and how to correct them. Real-time diagnosis helps you learn faster.

#### _If you miss class_

We understand that there can be various reasons for missing class.  If you miss class for whatever reason, the lesson material will be available online.

### Tech Issues

We will try to minimize any technology issues and promptly address problems that arise on our end with the resources where we as instructors have responsibility (e.g., Blackboard content, provided code samples).  However, you are responsible for the tech in your possession (namely your laptop, but also your network access). If you are having problems with your hardware that require service or repair, please let us know promptly so we can try to accommodate your disruption.

### Continuity Plans

Given the current times, there are constant changes and new University guidance regarding University operations.  There is also the possibility that a student, instructor, or family member that they care for may become ill and alternate arragements will need to be made.

We will follow all University guidance.  Typically we learn official University guidance at the same time as you.  We will promptly follow up with you about how the latest guidance impacts this class.

In the event that you as a student are unable to continue with the course, please notify us immediately so that we can discuss your options.  With two Instructors, hopefully there will be no disruptions, but we will continue as planned at the same day/time with a backup instructor if necessary.

### How will you be graded?

This course requires students to apply the analysis techniques learned in class on sample datasets to a dataset used in their own research. Your grade will consiste of 50% _homework assignments_ and 50% your _final project_ and calculated as follows:

* Homework Assignments: 50%
* Final Project: 50% (25% Github repository and website; 25% presentation)

#### _Assignments_
Assignments are given most weeks and require you to add something to the previous week’s analysis of your dataset, building on your work.  It is in your best interest to complete these assignments on time in order to keep up with the class.  Assignments will be given in class. Several of the assignments will be formally graded. **You will turn in each assignment by providing a Github link to it.** Instructions will be provided in class.

Assignments will be graded as satisfactory (A), not satisfactory (C), or not/minimally attempted (F) promptly after the due date. Feedback will be provided via Blackboard or Github Issues.

If the assignment is graded not satisfactory or not attempted, **you may redo the assignment** until it is satisfactory until the last day of class (Dec 3). The point of analysis with climate data is to get it done right... ultimately! There is no shame in revising work to make it better - coding is an iterative process. But you must notify us if/when you wish us to re-grade a re-submitted assignment.

#### _Final Project_
In addition to the graded assignments, You are also expected to complete a project with a website in Github and give a presentation in class of your project. Project details will be provided in class and posted on Blackboard.

#### _Exams_
This class has no exams.

### University Policies

#### _Evolving COVID Situation_ 

All students are required to follow the university’s public health and safety precautions and procedures outlined on the university [Safe Return to Campus webpage](https://www2.gmu.edu/safe-return-campus). Mason classrooms are mask-optional, but masks are encouraged, especially in close quarters or where ventilation is low. If you're more comfortable wearing a mask, feel free to continue. If you feel ill or test positive for COVID, please do not attend class, inform the instructor and observe [quarantine guidance](https://www.gmu.edu/safe-return-campus/personal-and-public-health/isolation-and-quarantine).

GMU strongly recommends vaccinations for all students who work, study, or live on campus. This includes those who attend classes. There is nothing better than the in-person learning experience. Mason offers flexible excused absence options for students receiving vaccination and those with side effects after vaccination. If you are healthy – please be in class!  

If the campus closes, or if a class meeting needs to be canceled or adjusted due to weather or other reasons, notices will be posted to Blackboard and emailed to all registered students. 

#### _Academic integrity_

It is expected that students adhere to the George Mason University Honor Code as it relates to integrity regarding coursework and grades.  The Honor Code reads as follows: To promote a stronger sense of mutual responsibility, respect, trust, and fairness among all members of the George Mason University community and with the desire for greater academic and personal achievement, we, the student members of the University Community have set forth this: Student members of the George Mason University community pledge __not__ to cheat, plagiarize, steal and/or lie in matters related to academic work. More information about the Honor Code, including definitions of cheating, lying, and plagiarism, can be found at the Office of Academic Integrity website at (http://oai.gmu.edu).  __In this class, working together is strongly encouraged and doing so is not a violation of the Honor Code. However, each student must complete their own analysis codes and figures, and their own writeup of each assignment.__

#### _Diversity and Inclusion_

Diversity and inclusion mean much more than _do not harrass_.  They mean creating an environment where diverse viewpoints and perpsectives are welcome and everyone feels they are part of the team.  This class aims to be an intentionally inclusive community that promotes and maintains an equitable and just work and learning environment. We welcome and value individuals and their differences including race, economic status, gender expression and identity, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, national origin, first language, religion, age, and disability.
